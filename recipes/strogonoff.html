    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a delicious Stroganoff that my Nana made all the time. My
      husband's favorite meal is Stroganoff, and before we met he never had
      homemade Stroganoff sauce. Once my mom made this for him, he has never
      eaten any other! Serve over rice or egg noodles.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1/4-inch wide strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 cup mushrooms</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups chilled beef stock</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Shake 1 tablespoon flour with salt in a large, resealable plastic bag
        until combined; add beef and shake to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown beef
        in the hot butter, about 3 minutes per side. Stir mushrooms, onion, and
        garlic into beef; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 3 to 4
        minutes. Transfer beef and vegetables to a bowl, leaving drippings in
        skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 more tablespoons butter in skillet over medium heat. Cook and
        stir 3 tablespoons flour in the hot butter until smooth; stir tomato
        paste into flour mixture. Whisk beef stock into mixture and cook,
        stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and bubbling, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return beef and vegetables to skillet and stir to coat with sauce.
        Reduce heat to very low and simmer until beef is tender, 2 to 3 hours.
        The longer it cooks, the more tender the meat will be. Just before
        serving, stir sour cream and white wine into beef mixture and heat
        through. Do not boil.
